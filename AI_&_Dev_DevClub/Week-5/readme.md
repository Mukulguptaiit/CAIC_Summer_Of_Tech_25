# 🚀 ML+Dev Track: Week 5  
## 🌍 Deployment & Showcasing (Final Project)

### 🔁 Quick Recap  
Last week, you:  
- Built a frontend that connects to both your APIs  
- Created a working local app where users can generate tweets and predict likes  
- Tested the full flow from user input to ML predictions  
- Had your first complete full-stack AI application running locally

Now, it's time to **ship it to the world**! 🌟  

Your goal this week:  
**Deploy your app online and create professional documentation**

---  

## 🎯 Week 5 Goals  

By the end of this week, you will:
- Deploy your complete system to the web (accessible via URL)
- Create a clean GitHub repository with good documentation
- Polish your code and make it production-ready

**✅ Deliverable: Hosted working demo + GitHub repo with README**

## 🌐 Step 1: Deploy Your Application

### Option A: Streamlit App → HuggingFace Spaces (Easiest)

If you used Streamlit in Week 4, this is the simplest path:

1. **Combine everything into one file:**
```python
# app.py
import streamlit as st
import joblib
import pandas as pd
from tweet_generator import SimpleTweetGenerator
from textblob import TextBlob

# Load your model directly (no separate API needed)
@st.cache_resource
def load_model():
    return joblib.load('like_predictor.pkl')

@st.cache_resource
def load_generator():
    return SimpleTweetGenerator()

model = load_model()
generator = load_generator()

st.title("🚀 Tweet Intelligence Engine")
st.write("Generate tweets and predict their engagement!")

# Your UI code from Week 4 here...
company = st.text_input("Company Name", "Nike")
tweet_type = st.selectbox("Tweet Type", ["general", "announcement", "question"])
message = st.text_input("Message", "Something awesome!")

if st.button("Generate & Predict"):
    # Generate tweet
    generated_tweet = generator.generate_tweet(company, tweet_type, message)
    
    # Extract features and predict
    features = [[
        len(generated_tweet.split()),  # word_count
        len(generated_tweet),          # char_count
        False,                         # has_media
        12,                           # hour
        TextBlob(generated_tweet).sentiment.polarity  # sentiment
    ]]
    
    predicted_likes = model.predict(features)[0]
    
    st.success(f"Generated Tweet: {generated_tweet}")
    st.info(f"Predicted Likes: {int(predicted_likes)}")
```

2. **Create requirements.txt:**
```txt
streamlit
pandas
scikit-learn
joblib
textblob
numpy
```

3. **Deploy to HuggingFace Spaces:**
- Go to [huggingface.co/spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
- Click "Create new Space"
- Choose "Streamlit" as the SDK
- Upload your files

### Option B: Flask App → Render

If you used Flask:

1. **Create one combined Flask app:**
```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
import joblib
from tweet_generator import SimpleTweetGenerator
from textblob import TextBlob

app = Flask(__name__)
model = joblib.load('like_predictor.pkl')
generator = SimpleTweetGenerator()

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/generate_and_predict', methods=['POST'])
def generate_and_predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Generate tweet
    generated_tweet = generator.generate_tweet(
        data['company'],
        data['tweet_type'],
        data['message']
    )
    
    # Extract features and predict
    features = [[
        len(generated_tweet.split()),
        len(generated_tweet),
        data.get('has_media', False),
        12,
        TextBlob(generated_tweet).sentiment.polarity
    ]]
    
    predicted_likes = model.predict(features)[0]
    
    return jsonify({
        'generated_tweet': generated_tweet,
        'predicted_likes': int(predicted_likes)
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

2. **Deploy to Render:**
- Connect your GitHub repo to [render.com](https://render.com)
- Create a new Web Service
- Start command: `python app.py`

## 📝 Step 2: Create a Good README

Put this in your GitHub repository:

```markdown
# 🚀 Tweet Intelligence Engine

Generate tweets and predict their engagement using AI!

## 🌟 What it does
- **Generate tweets** from company name and message
- **Predict likes** using machine learning
- **Interactive UI** for testing different inputs

## 🔗 Try it live
**[Live Demo](your-deployment-url)**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit/Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning

## 📊 How it works
1. User enters company name and message
2. AI generates tweet using templates
3. ML model predicts how many likes it will get
4. Results shown instantly

## 🚀 Run locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tweet-intelligence-engine
cd tweet-intelligence-engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📈 Built during
CAIC Summer of Technology 2025 - 5 week ML+Dev track

## 🗂️ Step 3: Organize Your Code

Structure your GitHub repo like this:

```
tweet-intelligence-engine/
├── README.md              # Your documentation
├── app.py                 # Main application
├── tweet_generator.py     # Your generator from Week 3
├── like_predictor.pkl     # Your model from Week 2
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
└── .gitignore            # Hide unnecessary files
```

## 🙋 Week 5 FAQs

**Q: What if my deployment doesn't work?**  
A: Try the local version first. If that works, the issue is usually in requirements.txt or file paths.

**Q: Do I need to keep the separate APIs from Week 2 and 3?**  
A: No! You can combine everything into one file now. Much simpler for deployment.

**Q: What if someone finds bugs in my app?**  
A: That's normal! Add basic error handling and mention limitations in your README.

**Q: Should I make the PowerPoint?**  
A: Only if you want to! Focus on getting the app working first.

**Ship it and share it! 🚀**
