# Brain Tumor Detection with CNNs - CSoT'25 Week 4 Project

## Introduction

Welcome to Week 4 of the CSoT'25 CS Research program by ARIES x ACES ACM! This week, we apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to a real-world challenge: detecting brain tumors from MRI scans. You'll build a complete deep learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, resulting in a functional classification model.

## Goal and Learning Objectives

The goal is to create a binary classification model to detect brain tumors in MRI scans. By completing this project, you will:

- Process and prepare a raw dataset.
- Implement and train a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluate model performance and visualize results.
- Gain hands-on experience with a real-world medical imaging application.

## Dataset

The **Brain MRI Dataset for Tumor Detection** is used for this project. Key details:

- **Content**: Two folders:
  - `yes`: MRI scans of brains with tumors.
  - `no`: MRI scans of brains without tumors.
- **Format**: Standard image files (.jpg or .png).
- **Significance**: A classic dataset for binary image classification, with applications in medical diagnostics.
- **Access**: [Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudipde25/mri-dataset-for-detection-and-analysis/data)

## Tasks

1. **Environment Setup and Data Exploration**

   - Set up a Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
   - Download the dataset and load images from the `yes` and `no` folders.
   - Visualize sample images from each class to understand the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**

   - Resize images to a uniform size (e.g., 150x150 pixels).
   - Normalize pixel values.
   - Assign numerical labels (1 for tumor, 0 for no tumor).
   - Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing.

3. **Model Building and Training**

   - Use TensorFlow/Keras to create a sequential CNN with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, ending with a sigmoid activation.
   - Compile the model.
   - Train the model using the `fit` method with training and validation data for a set number of epochs.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Plot accuracy and loss curves from the model's training history.
   - Evaluate the model on the test set using the `evaluate` method to obtain the final accuracy score.

## Submission Guidelines

- **What to Submit**: A single link to your Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the link is publicly accessible. In Google Colab, set "General access" to "Anyone with the link" via the "Share" option.
- **Notebook Requirements**:
  - Clean, well-commented code with all cell outputs.
  - Clearly display the final test accuracy score.
- **Submission Form**: [Submit here!!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTv8HNTAIdrZ31FiGeS-uv2f7qscx5dAnUjVrupxlbhFL17A/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115413717050185681699)

## Optional Challenges

For those eager to go further:

- **Data Augmentation**: Use Kerasâ€™ `ImageDataGenerator` to apply random transformations (e.g., rotations, zooms, flips) to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.
- **Architecture Experimentation**: Modify the CNN by adding more `Conv2D` layers or `Dropout` layers to prevent overfitting. Test if these changes improve test accuracy.
