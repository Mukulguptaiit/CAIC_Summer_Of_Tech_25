# Analyzing Light Pollution, its impact and finding ways to reduce it

**Format:** You can participate solo or in teams of max 2.

## Introduction

Light pollution, the excessive or misdirected artificial light in the night environment, is a growing global concern. It diminishes our view of the cosmos and has significant environmental consequences, affecting ecosystems, wildlife, and human health.

In this project, you will investigate light pollution by analyzing real-world data to quantify, visualize, and understand its patterns and impact. This involves conducting research into the causes and effects of light pollution, analyzing satellite and ground-based data, and proposing effective solutions to mitigate this issue.

This project offers an excellent opportunity to apply and enhance your research papers analysis, data science, programming, and scientific communication skills. You will work with real-world datasets, employ powerful analytical tools, and contribute to a better understanding of this crucial environmental issue.

To better understand the significance of this environmental hazard, explore this  [Light Pollution Map by National Geographic Map Maker](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=b296947d717643e5805378a5c3f5e6eb)(Reload if it isn't opening), which illustrates its widespread effects on the world.

## What You'll Do in This Project

This project combines research, data analysis, and scientific reporting. You will:

- **Conduct Research:** Start by reading scientific papers to build a strong understanding of what light pollution is, its different types, its effects on the environment and astronomy, and how it's measured.
- **Analyze Data:** Using either Python or MATLAB, you'll work with data from satellites like VIIRS and DMSP-OLS. You will clean this data, calculate statistics, and create visualizations like maps and charts to show light pollution trends, possibly focusing on a specific area like Delhi.
- **Propose Solutions:** Based on your research and analysis, you will investigate the primary causes of light pollution and suggest effective solutions, including innovative lighting designs.
- **Create a Final Report:** You will compile all your findings, analysis, visualizations, and proposed solutions into a professional scientific report using LaTeX.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- **Scientific Reporting:** To document the methodology, analysis, and results in a scientific report
- **Data Acquisition and Processing:** To collect and process light pollution data from various sources, such as satellite imagery and ground-based sensors.
- **Data Analysis:** To analyze the processed data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in light pollution levels. This could involve studying the growth of light pollution over time, its relationship with population density, or its impact on nearby flora and fauna, public health, atmosphere and more.
- **Visualization:** To create compelling visualizations, such as maps and charts, to effectively communicate the analysis findings.

## Background Research and Literature Review

A crucial component of this project is a thorough understanding of the subject matter. All participants must conduct a comprehensive literature review before diving into report making and data analysis. This will form the foundation of your project's introduction and help you interpret your results in a broader scientific context.

**Primary Activities:**

- Conducting a systematic literature search using academic resources
- Understanding the core concepts of light scattering, absorption, and reflection; identifying key satellites that measure light pollution; and familiarizing yourself with relevant terminology.
- Reviewing current and proposed mitigation policies, lighting technologies, and international standards.
- Using a reference manager to organize your sources is essential for proper citation in your final report.
